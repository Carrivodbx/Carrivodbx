## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state with optimistic updates and caching
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme variables for the luxury aesthetic (neon borders, glass morphism effects, gradient text)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation via @hookform/resolvers
- **Design System**: Custom color palette with primary (silver/grey), secondary (black/dark grey), and accent (light silver) colors for a sober, elegant, and luxurious aesthetic

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy using scrypt for password hashing
- **Session Management**: express-session with PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with role-based access control
- **Build System**: esbuild for production builds, tsx for development

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless)
- **Database Schema**:
  - `users`: Authentication and profile data with role field (client/agency)
  - `agencies`: Agency-specific information linked to user accounts
  - `vehicles`: Car listings with pricing, availability, and location
  - `reservations`: Booking records with date ranges and payment status
  - `subscriptions`: Premium agency subscriptions for enhanced visibility
- **Session Store**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for authentication persistence

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strategy**: Session-based authentication with secure password hashing (scrypt with salt)
- **User Roles**: Two-tier system (client and agency) with route-level protection
- **Protected Routes**: ProtectedRoute component wrapper checks authentication before rendering
- **Session Security**: HTTP-only cookies, configurable session secrets, trust proxy settings for production
- **Email Verification**: Token-based email verification with hashed tokens (emailVerified, verificationTokenHash, verificationTokenExpires fields)
- **Password Reset**: Dual-channel reset (email and SMS) with dedicated token fields (resetTokenHash, resetTokenExpires, resetChannel, resetTarget)

### Payment Integration
- **Provider**: Stripe with support for card payments and Apple Pay
- **Payment Flow**: 
  - One-time payments for reservations with 90/10 split (agency/platform)
  - Recurring subscriptions for agency premium membership (â‚¬29.99/month)
  - Client-side: @stripe/stripe-js and @stripe/react-stripe-js for payment UI
  - Server-side: Stripe API integration with webhook support for payment confirmation
- **Revenue Model**: 10% platform commission on bookings, premium subscription upsell for agencies
